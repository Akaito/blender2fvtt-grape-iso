Work in progress!  Very much not ready yet!

## TODO / next steps

- [x] Create tiles in Foundry with some nonsense image,
      but positioned reasonably and hooked to the right walls.
      Then the user can change the tile images as desired.
- [ ] Hook nonsense-image tiles to walls.


## Ideas / future
- Can we provide a quick-wall macro?
  1. Draw a (square) template.
  2. Hover its control icon.
  3. Press the macro's hotkey.
  4. Macro makes walls at the template's edges.
  5. Macro makes a tile and hooks it to the walls.
  6. User manually changes wall's image.
