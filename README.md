Work in progress!  Very much not ready yet!

## TODO / next steps

- [x] Create tiles in Foundry with some nonsense image,
      but positioned reasonably and hooked to the right walls.
      Then the user can change the tile images as desired.
- [x] Hook nonsense-image tiles to walls.
- [ ] Better tile positions?
      Have to figure out what 'better' even means here.
      For a first go, probably just make it so using one of Isometric Worlds'
      tiles doesn't need re-adjustment after.  Or at least minimal
      re-adjustment.


## Ideas / future
- Can we provide a quick-wall macro?
  1. Draw a (square) template.
  2. Hover its control icon.
  3. Press the macro's hotkey.
  4. Macro makes walls at the template's edges.
  5. Macro makes a tile and hooks it to the walls.
  6. User manually changes wall's image.
